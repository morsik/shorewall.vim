This is a first approach to make a syntax check and highlighting script for shorewall (http://www.shorewall.net). 

It's not heavily tested yet, but it works. It renders you a nice colored rules file and it also check for basic typing errors such as invalid characters, mistyped protocol names or incorrect white spaces that may prevent  the firewall to start.
